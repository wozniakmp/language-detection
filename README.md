This is a project created for the course *Introduction to Deep Learning for NLP*.

## Language detection

This is a simple ML/NLP project in which I builded and trained 3 neural networks to recognise the input language. The training was downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/basilb2s/language-detection). In the original version, all models use bag-of-words representation to recognise a language. As the next steps, I am going to implement n-grams repersentation and investigate if it improved models' accuracy. The models differ in numbers of layers/neurons and activation functions.
